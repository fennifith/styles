	<h1>Styles</h1>
	<p>
		This page contains documentation and examples of all of the CSS styles used 
		throughout <a href="https://jfenn.me/">my site</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Much of the guidelines in this styleguide are based on Google's
		<a href="https://material.io/design/foundation-overview/">Material Foundation</a>,
		which have been adapted for my own use. As this documentation is intended for
		function over form, it lacks a lot of the fine specification included with the
		material components. As I am generally lazy at documenting things, some text and
		explanations are not very well written. I hope to improve on this in the future.
